* lua 5.1
* python3

Building vim:
    checking if compile and link flags for Perl are sane... no: PERL DISABLED
    need lua installed before building with --enable-lua-interp
    consider tcl, lua, ruby, other options

* ipython notebook wants pyzmq - SOCK_CLOEXEC undeclared
* Split installation for RHEL3 and RHEL5.
* Use 32-bit anaconda for RHEL5 as shortcut to lots of good packages
* Bootstrapping in a different directory such as a device directory
    * May do as the anaconda installer and install to `/opt/anaconda1anaconda2` replacing this string with the real location to make a moveable feast.
* octave -- maybe. RHEL3 has octave. RHEL5 is missing octave.
* pytables
* scipy -- requires fortran
* Better handling of missing scripts and other build faiures -- should stop on build failure
* "make check" everything -- option to do while building or do it later
* Download All script -- in case you're not able to download packages from your build location
* script to check that all `bin` and `lib` objects are 32-bit
* Option (or default) to build in `/tmp/`. Building on NFS can have weird effects when timestamps are checked. Perl keeps thinking Makefile is out of date wrt Makefile.PL
* Octave needs fortran -- who knew fortran was such a big deal?
* hdf5 before octave
* building vim: remove -lieee from TCL options in src/auto/config.mk
* vim is missing my ~/.vimrc -- well ntk.vim anyway -- oh wait, it's not included with Antikc yet.
