For all scripts: Don't try to download if you already have it.
Install tck/tk before git if you want gitk on RHEL3 (difficult irc)

Building vim:
    checking if compile and link flags for Perl are sane... no: PERL DISABLED
    need lua installed before building with --enable-lua-interp
    consider tcl, lua, ruby, other options

* Sqlite before ipython
* matplotlib needs a backend - says tk.h could not be found
* ipython notebook wants pyzmq - SOCK_CLOEXEC undeclared
* wget - to fix --no-check-certificate

* Split installation for RHEL3 and RHEL5.
* Use 32-bit anaconda for RHEL5 as shortcut to lots of good packages
* Bootstrapping in a different directory such as a device directory
    * May do as the anaconda installer and install to `/opt/anaconda1anaconda2` replacing this string with the real location to make a moveable feast.
* octave -- maybe. RHEL3 has octave. RHEL5 is missing octave.
* pytables
* scipy -- requires fortran
* wget -- requires gnutls, libnettle, gmp
* Better handling of missing scripts and other build faiures -- should stop on build failure
* "make check" everything -- option to do while building or do it later
* Download All script -- in case you're not able to download packages from your build location
* script to check that all `bin` and `lib` objects are 32-bit
* may need new libtool to compile gnutls on RHEL3
