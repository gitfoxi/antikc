Install tck/tk before git if you want gitk on RHEL3 (difficult irc)

Building vim:
    checking if compile and link flags for Perl are sane... no: PERL DISABLED
    need lua installed before building with --enable-lua-interp
    consider tcl, lua, ruby, other options

* Sqlite before ipython
* matplotlib needs a backend - says tk.h could not be found
* ipython notebook wants pyzmq - SOCK_CLOEXEC undeclared
* wget - to fix --no-check-certificate

Matplotlib
try: link libtcl.so -> libtcl8.5.so, libtk.so -> libtk8.5.so
try: setup.cfg 
	basedirlist = /home/quantenna/michaelf/93000/antikc/32bit,/usr
try: CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -I/usr/include/freetype2"
and after all that it segfaults in Tcl_CreateCommand in libtcl.so

... getting closer ...

* Split installation for RHEL3 and RHEL5.
* Use 32-bit anaconda for RHEL5 as shortcut to lots of good packages
* Bootstrapping in a different directory such as a device directory
    * May do as the anaconda installer and install to `/opt/anaconda1anaconda2` replacing this string with the real location to make a moveable feast.
